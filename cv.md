My goal is to get a job in programming.  I am interested in learning new technologies, so working in this area is a good idea! Since this area requires a good command of English, I can always improve my vocabulary, which in the future will help me in traveling around the world.  I love traveling.
A Junior Developer should always develop his programming and communication skills.  Self-training is an integral part of the programmer.
